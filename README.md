# Summary of program

Standing in the dock at Bejing capital airport
Trying to get to Vietnam  or India
The man in the Military fatigues
said,"You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ! You know it ain't easy. You know hard it can be.The way things are going. They're going to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Bora Bora
Honeymooning down by Motu trevairoa
 Lady Gaga
called to say,
"You can make it OK. You can get married in Seychelles
near Sydney
Christ! You know it ain't easy. You know hard it can be.The way things are going. They're going to crucify me
Drove from Mombasa
to the Nairobi
Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The men from the press
said,"Say what you doing in bed?"
I said,"We're only trying to get us some peace"
Christ! You know it ain't easy. You know hard it can be.The way things are going. They're going to crucify me
Saving up your Loot
for a Feezing
day.
Giving all your Peso's
to charity.
Last night the wife said,
"Oh boy, when you're dead. You don't take nothing with you. But your soul, think!"
Made a lightning trip to Boston
Eating Boston cream pie
in a bag.
The Rappers
said, "She's gone to his head. They look just like two hippies
in drag"
Christ! You know it ain't easy. You know hard it can be.The way things are going. They're going to crucify me
Caught an early plane back to krugerrands
Fifty  shilling
tied in a sack
The typebloggers
from the Social Media
said, "We wish you success. It's good to have the both of you back"
Christ! You know it ain't easy. You know hard it can be.The way things are going. They're going to crucify me
